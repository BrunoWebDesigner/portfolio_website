# A portfolio website created using React App.

Check out the completed website here: [My Portfolio](https://brunowebdesigner.github.io/portfolio_website/).

## Project Details

Conheça algumas características do meu projeto:

### `Utilizing React`

This was a project developed with React, built using .jsx components. Visit [react.dev](https://react.dev/) to learn more about React.

### `Page Routing`

Create React App doesn't include page routing.\
React Router is the most popular solution and I used it in my code. [React Router](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp) for more information.

### `Navbar`

I built a responsive navbar with a sandwich icon and a side window..\
One cool detail is that the background remains hidden and only appears when scrolling the page. To achieve this, I created a changeColor function, which can be found in the code here on GitHub, in the Navbar.js file.

### `Icons`

I obtained some icons as .png images, but for the GitHub and LinkedIn icons, I used the Font Awesome library, which I installed in my project following the instructions provided on  [fontawasome.com](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react/).

### `Styling Details`

This website was created with a lot of care to showcase my efforts and also to learn various things. That's why I invested time in styling details.

The animation on the edges of my photo on the Homepage was created using CSS. This code is clearly highlighted in the Hero.module.css file as **MY BUBBLE FACE**.

Some titles and images have a fade-in transition, and for that, I learned to use the library [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). Click and learn more if you're interested.

### `Responsiveness`

Throughout the project, I took user satisfaction into consideration on any device and screen size used.\
Most of the modifications were made using CSS @media queries.

Notice that the image in the career timeline on the About tab is adjusted for better visibility on smaller screens.

### `Carousel Component`

With the help of some components found online, I built and customized an image carousel showcasing the friendships I have made at work.\
In this work, I created a constant and placed the objects inside the Carousel.js file.

### `Projects Cards Component`

It was created using the [mui.com](https://mui.com/) library.

In this component, I used a method to retrieve information from a data.json file, making the addition of new projects dynamic.\
Interesting to note that in this component, I organized the styling using the MUI library within the Album.js file.

### `Thank You`

Thank you for reaching this point. I am loving working on website development, and I hope you feel the same way.
